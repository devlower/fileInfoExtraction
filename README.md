File Info Extraction is a Python library that provides a simple and efficient way to extract various types of information from files, including their name, type, size, and creation/modification times.

The library uses the standard os and datetime modules to access file system information and provides an easy-to-use API for accessing file metadata. It also includes a number of utility functions for common file operations, such as finding keywords in a file or extracting specific lines.

File Info Extractor is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate into your Python projects. It can be used for a wide range of applications, like data analysis and research, file management and automation and cyber forensics.
